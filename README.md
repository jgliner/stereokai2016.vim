# Stereokai2016

*Stereokai2016* is a theme for [Vim](http://www.vim.org/ "Vim"), based on [Stereokai](https://github.com/gummesson/stereokai.vim "Stereokai"), which is a derivative of [Monokai-Refined](https://github.com/jaromero/vim-monokai-refined "Monokai Refined").

This includes several minor changes, mostly having to do with ES6 and JSX/React recognition. The intent was to mirror SublimeText's Javascript (Babel) syntax highlighting with the default Monokai Phoenix theme.
